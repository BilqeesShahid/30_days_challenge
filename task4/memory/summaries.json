        "summary": "This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the functional requirements for a Smart Queue & Token Management System. The system aims to replace traditional queues with a digital platform where citizens can generate tokens online, track their queue position in real-time, and receive alerts. It includes a Citizen Portal, Admin Dashboard, real-time queue updates, and service management for various public services.  The system caters to different user roles: Citizens, Admins, and Super Admins, each with specific functionalities like token generation, queue management, and service configuration.  It is a web-based system accessible on various devices, requiring internet connectivity and relying on assumptions like stable internet access at public offices and responsible token status updates by admins. The SRS details features like user registration, token generation, real-time queue status, admin token and counter management, service management, and analytics. Finally, it includes a database schema outlining the key tables and fields necessary for storing user, service, counter, and token data.\n",
