## 🔧 Installation of SpeckitPlus using command

**To install Spec-Kit Plus, ensure Python 3.12+ is installed, then run:**

```python 
pip install specifyplus

```
**Check version:**

```python
specifyplus --version 
```
**Output example:**

SpecifyPlus CLI v0.0.17


**🚀 Steps to Start Spec-Kit Plus**
1. Create a folder named **hello-speckit**
2. Open the folder in CMD
3. Run:
```python 
specifyplus init .
```
4. Spec-Kit Plus will initialize inside the folder
5. Select your AI assistant (***Gemini, Claude, etc.***)
6. Select script type (**bash or PowerShell**)

**Q1.** 🔹 What is SPECKit Plus? 

**A.** 🔹 Short Note on SPECKit Plus

SPECKit Plus is an SDD-RI framework (Specification-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence) that helps developers capture intelligence, not just produce code.
It follows a two-output philosophy: every feature generates working code (temporary) and reusable intelligence (permanent). The permanent intelligence includes reasoning, decisions, and effective prompts that improve your skills over time.

SPECKit Plus uses templates (specifications, plans, ADRs, PHRs), slash commands, and a structured directory system to preserve your thinking. It is not an AI tool—rather, it helps you work with AI tools like Claude or Gemini by giving your workflow clarity, structure, and long-term learning through Horizontal (learning) and Vertical (reusable components) intelligence. 


## ✅ Short Answers for the 5 Core Concepts

Below are short, simple explanations for each concept.

1️⃣ **/constitution – Project Standards**

The /constitution defines the overall rules, quality standards, and success criteria for the entire project.
It sets expectations for clarity, structure, documentation, and how the team will use AI.
This phase ensures the whole project follows consistent principles from start to finish.

2️⃣ **/specify – Write Clear Requirements**

The /specify command is used to create clear, testable specifications before coding begins.
It focuses on what needs to be built, using SMART criteria, user needs, and constraints.
This ensures the feature is understood fully before moving to planning or implementation.

3️⃣ **/plan – Architecture and Decisions**

The /plan phase generates the implementation plan, architecture decisions, and technology choices.
It answers how the feature will be built and records the reasoning inside ADRs (Architectural Decision Records).
This preserves long-term intelligence about why certain approaches were chosen.

4️⃣ **/tasks – Break Work Into Small Units**

The /tasks command breaks the plan into atomic, measurable tasks.
Each task becomes a small, clear unit of work with checkpoints and validation steps.
This helps avoid confusion, makes implementation easier, and guides the AI during coding.

5️⃣ **/implement – Execute With AI**

The /implement phase uses AI to execute the tasks and generate working code.
It transforms each task into a real feature while automatically creating a PHR (Prompt History Record).
This captures which prompts worked best, contributing to your long-term learning and intelligence.
